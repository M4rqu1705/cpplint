cpplint - static code checker for C++
=====================================

Cpplint is a command-line tool to check C/C++ files for style issues following `Google's C++ style guide <http://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html>`_.
Cpplint is developed and maintained by Google Inc. at `google/styleguide <https://github.com/google/styleguide>`_, also see the `wikipedia entry <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cpplint>`_

While Google maintains cpplint, Google is not (very) responsive to issues and pull requests, this fork aims to be (somewhat) more open to add fixes to cpplint to enable fixes, when those fixes make cpplint usable in wider contexts.
Also see discussion here https://github.com/google/styleguide/pull/528.

My Changes
----------

I made this repo because I *REALLY* need something ressembling to a `.gitignore` for cpplint. I wanted this repo to be super lightweight, so I decided to not fork it and instead copy the contents.
